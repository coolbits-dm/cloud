# M14: Adaptive Policy & Self-Healing - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 Objective Achieved

**CoolBits.ai now has adaptive policy enforcement** - no more manual "grep on logs" for policy gaps. The system now:

- **Enforces** → **Logs** → **Analyzes** → **Proposes fixes**
- **Self-heals** registry corruption automatically
- **Adapts** policies based on real violation patterns

## 🚀 Implementation Summary

### 1. Policy Violation Collector ✅
**File:** `cblm/opipe/nha/adaptive/collector.py`

- Reads `logs/policy-enforcement-*.jsonl` files
- Filters DENY/WARN violations
- Aggregates by time window (24h, 7d, custom)
- Produces JSON + Markdown reports
- Identifies missing scopes and secrets

**Usage:**
```bash
python -m cblm.opipe.nha.adaptive.collector \
  --logs-dir logs \
  --window last_24h \
  --include-warn --markdown
```

**Output:** `reports/policy_collect_last_24h.json` + `.md`

### 2. Policy Gap Analyzer ✅
**File:** `cblm/opipe/nha/adaptive/analyzer.py`

- Analyzes collected violation data
- Applies rules for gap identification:
  - Scope denied ≥5 times → candidate for policy
  - Secret missing ≥3 agents → check mapping
  - Unknown agent violations → force cleanup
- Categorizes by priority (high/medium/low)

**Usage:**
```bash
python -m cblm.opipe.nha.adaptive.analyzer \
  --collect-file reports/policy_collect_last_24h.json \
  --out-dir reports --markdown
```

**Output:** `reports/policy_gaps.json` + `.md`

### 3. Policy Recommender ✅
**File:** `cblm/opipe/nha/adaptive/recommender.py`

- Transforms gaps into concrete policy proposals
- Generates YAML ready-to-PR format:
  ```yaml
  policy_recommendations:
    agents:
    - id: nha:opypgpt03
      recommendations:
      - action: add_scope
        scope: write:rag
        rationale: "Observed 12 denies in last 7d"
  ```

**Usage:**
```bash
python -m cblm.opipe.nha.adaptive.recommender \
  --gaps-file reports/policy_gaps.json \
  --registry-file cblm/opipe/nha/agents.yaml \
  --out-file cblm/opipe/nha/policy_recommendations.yaml
```

**Output:** `cblm/opipe/nha/policy_recommendations.yaml`

### 4. Self-Healing Registry ✅
**File:** `scripts/policy_selfheal.py`

- Validates registry integrity (YAML syntax + structure)
- Auto-restores from backup if corrupted
- Reloads enforcer cache automatically
- Fail-closed mode for critical environments

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/policy_selfheal.py \
  --registry-file cblm/opipe/nha/agents.yaml \
  --backup-file cblm/opipe/nha/out/registry.json \
  --check-signature --auto-reload --fail-closed
```

### 5. CI/CD Integration ✅
**File:** `scripts/test_m14.py`

- Comprehensive verification of all components
- Tests complete adaptive pipeline
- Validates file structure and functionality
- **6/6 tests passing** ✅

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/test_m14.py
```

### 6. Monitoring Dashboard ✅
**File:** `monitoring/adaptive_policy_dashboard.json`

- Real-time policy violation metrics
- Top violating agents tracking
- Missing scopes/secrets monitoring
- Registry health status
- Self-healing events tracking
- Policy recommendations status

## 🔄 Adaptive Pipeline Flow

```
Policy Enforcement → Audit Logs → Collector → Analyzer → Recommender → Policy Updates
       ↓                    ↓           ↓         ↓          ↓            ↓
   DENY/WARN         JSONL Files    Aggregated   Gap IDs   YAML PRs   Registry
   Decisions         (Daily)        Violations   Found     Ready      Updates
```

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Policy Violations:** Real-time monitoring of DENY/WARN decisions
- **Gap Analysis:** Automated identification of policy gaps
- **Recommendations:** Concrete proposals for policy updates
- **Registry Health:** Integrity validation and auto-recovery
- **Self-Healing:** Automatic restoration from corruption

## 🎯 Definition of Done - ACHIEVED ✅

- ✅ Collector runs daily and produces aggregated JSON
- ✅ Analyzer outputs reports with real gaps
- ✅ Recommender writes YAML with concrete proposals
- ✅ Self-heal works (registry corrupted → rollback OK)
- ✅ CI blocks if gaps exist unaddressed
- ✅ Dashboard has "Adaptive Policy" panel with metrics

## 🔒 Anti-Regression Measures

- ✅ No policy added directly → only as PR with owner+review
- ✅ Recommender marks "rationale" for each proposal
- ✅ Deploy blocked if registry live ≠ signature of last build
- ✅ All components verified with comprehensive tests

## 🎉 Final Result

**CoolBits.ai has transitioned from reactive enforcement to adaptive policy + self-healing.**

The system now:
- **Enforces** policies strictly (deny by default)
- **Analyzes** violations automatically (no more grep on logs)
- **Proposes** fixes intelligently (ready-to-PR YAML)
- **Heals** itself when corrupted (automatic recovery)

**Zero excuses, zero bypass, zero manual intervention.**
