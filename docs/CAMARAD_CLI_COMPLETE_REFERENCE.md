# Camarad CLI Complete Reference

## Usage

`python3 cli/camarad.py camarad-exec [OPTIONS]`

For backward compatibility, the legacy command `camard-exec` is still accepted.

The `camarad-exec` command is the primary entrypoint for orchestrating automation, maintenance, and manual governance tasks across the empire. All guarded operations (lockdowns, ingests, upkeep, etc.) are exposed via CLI flags.
